## Project Motivation <a name="toc2"></a>
I wanted to discover connections between various statistics from PGA Tour players.
Data was taken entirely from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jmpark746/pga-tour-data-2010-2018)
which was webscraped from the [pga.com](https://www.pgatour.com/) website.  The
primary goal was to answer the following questions:<br>
 - Does the lowest score correlate to making the most money?<br>
 - What aspect of the golf game relates most to the highest money made?<br>
 - Have golf courses evolved since 2010 leading to different stats contributing
 differently to success?<br>
 - Are those who play more rounds more likely to shoot lower scores?<br>

The end goal of this project is to create actionable insights into the game of
golf for a PGA Tour professional.<br>

## File Descriptions <a name="toc3"></a>
All the programming is contained within a single jupyter notebook,
[PGA_Analysis.ipynb](./PGA_Analysis.ipynb), and the data files are in the
[data](./data/) directory.

## Project Details
The technical details and code can be found in the [jupyter notebook](./PGA_Analysis.ipynb),
or the reported discoveries can be found in a [Medium post]().

## Licensing and Acknowledgements
Credit must be given to [Jong](https://www.kaggle.com/jmpark746) on Kaggle for his
work in webscraping all the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/jmpark746/pga-tour-data-2010-2018)
that is used in this project.
